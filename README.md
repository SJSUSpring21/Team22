## Idea 1 : Grocery Items Recommendation Systems and Basket Data Analysis

### Groceries are a staple and repetitive part of our daily life. We often tend to gravitate towards similar grocery products/brands as most of our friends/family and with the help of  user-user collaborative filtering, one can filter out the items that a user might like based on the reaction of similar users. We can also use *Apriori Algorithm* for the below insights for the below problems,if X & Y are frequently bought together:

#### Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.

#### Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.

#### Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.

#### X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.

## Idea 2 : Using US Facts.org Immigration data to predict H1-B Visa approvals/rejections 

### We propose to build a dashboard to enter user data and use those features to plug into our model, trained on Immigration data from USFacts.org to predict whether their H1-B visa would get approved/rejected and also suggest possible key metrics for approval/rejection for future applicants.


## Idea 3 : Sentiment Analysis of r/WallStreetBets sub reddit posts and correlation with $GME stock prices movements

### Recently, a few thousand Redditors tried to take on the Wall Street stalwarts by try to buy and hold GME stock options against a big short position held by major conglomerates on Wall Street and a sentiment analysis on the sub reddit posts data could help investigate the correlation between GME stock price vs. the growing subp-reddit user opinions to figure out the complete story.
