## Project Title - GrocerSmart - A smart grocery store management application for store managers

### Introduction - AI is one of the most powerful tool that we use in business today. With correct data we can use the power of AI to take important decisons in our business and also to plan our inventory and products. Our application will use this power of AI to help grocery shop owners determine which products they should promote. This application will also help them to decide what should be in there inventory.

### Abstract - This application will answer the two most important questions to retailers - which products they should promote and what should be there in the inventory. For this, we will use the past data of favorita store in ecuador. This dataset includes thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The training data includes dates, store and item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit sales. From this we can predict which items are sold more and which items we should promote.
